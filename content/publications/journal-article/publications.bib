	abstract = {There is not enough water in California to support current water uses and preserve healthy environments. California aquifers have been chronically depleted over decades, causing household water insecurity, degrading groundwater-dependent ecosystems, affecting small and medium farmers, and inducing subsidence. The California government enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act more than a decade ago to prevent declining aquifer levels to continue causing undesirable results, which has driven the necessity to reduce irrigated agriculture by about half million hectares. If this change is left to market forces alone, cropland retirement could disrupt local economies and vulnerable communities, increasing the levels of injustice for local residents and threatening farmer and farmworker livelihoods. However, when cropland repurposing is strategically organized and managed in collaboration among all the involved groups, it can enhance quality of life in agricultural disadvantaged communities, diversify regional economies, generate local socioeconomic opportunities, and improve environmental health while simultaneously fostering food and nutrition security and advancing water sustainability. In this study, we present a systems-level, coproduced Framework of best practices in cropland repurposing to achieve socioenvironmental and economic benefits for all. The Framework is informed and supported by peer-reviewed science, authors' first-hand experiences, and public engagement about the topic for several years. Our team includes scientists, community leaders, and other experts in cropland repurposing, socioenvironmental justice, agriculture, climate change, land trusts, disadvantaged communities, energy, nonprofit work, Indigenous knowledge, and ecosystems. The Framework includes guiding objectives, best practices, and implementation strategies to overcome co-occurring challenges. We conduct an extensive literature review of the current status quo to support the best practices identified in our Framework. This review and coproduced Framework aim to provide best practices for developing new solutions without causing new problems, while fully considering the impacts on all groups affected firsthand by cropland repurposing.},

	abstract = {Conservation planning that enhances the resiliency of biodiversity to climate change requires adaptive water and land use decision-making in the most cost-efficient way. This has many challenges since landscapes with high biodiversity can embrace intense human production activities, particularly agriculture. Conventionally, water and land used for conservation are often regarded as tradeoffs to agricultural productivity. However, this study found that agricultural water and land use synergize with shorebird conservation in the Central Valley, California. If informed decisions are made to guide strategic land use, landscapes can adapt to climate change and offer multiple benefits. This study used a coupled economic optimization model with a species distribution model to consider human factors in ecological impacts. The objective was to assess the impacts of agricultural water and land use decisions under different climate change scenarios on 10 shorebird species populations in California's Central Valley. Our results showed that strategic water and land management can offer favorable habitats to targeted shorebirds with a land composition including diversified crop categories complementary to wetlands. This study demonstrates that agricultural lands can be as important as wetlands to shorebirds to sustain their migratory stages throughout the year. Wetland restoration without species habitat preference information can lead to population shrinkage since wetland types vary in habitat importance to the shorebird species studied in this research. Business as usual, along with land use and climate change, will decrease shorebirds' breeding season and population to the same degree as they impact non-breeding populations. The synergies between agricultural production and shorebird conservation were found in the scenarios that favor agricultural production water use but also favor habitat provisioning to shorebirds in the Central Valley, California, under climate change.},

	abstract = {Reliance on groundwater during drought cycles is a common cause of overdraft conditions, particularly in regions dominated by irrigated agriculture. Groundwater overdraft is evidenced by declining water table levels, widespread well failure, and land subsidence. Given the severity of these outcomes, natural resource managers are under increasing pressure to create economic and equitable sustainability plans in response to human water demands and climate change impacts. This work describes the development of a novel toolkit (software) designed to support multicriteria decisions centered around restoring groundwater sustainability in overdrafted regions. The toolkit was developed collaboratively with participants in California’s Multibenefit Land Repurposing Program ({MLRP}), which aims to repurpose irrigated agricultural land to reduce groundwater extraction while providing multiple benefits. The toolkit integrates existing spatial data layers using a Web-based, open-source package (Shiny R) to assess the suitability of land for repurposing. We used fuzzy logic to create six land repurposing suitability indices for (1) enhancing groundwater recharge, (2) minimizing negative impacts to the agricultural economy, (3) increasing renewable energy production, (4) increasing wildlife habitat restoration and conservation, (5) mitigating local flood risk, and (6) reducing environmental health risks in disadvantaged communities. These indices (or subsets) can be combined as weighted averages to create user-specified multibenefit scenarios. The resulting output can be inspected locally to screen prospective land parcels based on their repurposing potential, or holistically to prioritize specific areas in the context of regional land repurposing strategies. We illustrate the development, application, and possible uses of the toolkit in the context of two critically overdrafted groundwater subbasins, Tule and Kaweah, both located in California’s San Joaquin Valley. The methods described are transferable to other overdrafted regions assuming that adequate geospatial data is available. Given its Web-accessibility and user-controlled weighting scheme, the {MLRP} toolkit can facilitate regional coordination of resource agencies and stakeholders and help to maximize multiple benefits of land repurposing while achieving groundwater sustainability.},

	abstract = {Achieving water sustainability in many water-scarce regions will require reducing consumptive water use by converting irrigated agricultural land to less water intensive uses. Conventional approaches to this challenge that emphasize water conservation as a singular objective often promote ad hoc practices that temporarily leave land idle while missing an opportunity to enhance landscape resilience and harness synergies of managing water and land together. Multibenefit land repurposing offers an alternative solution to this challenge by strategically transitioning irrigated agricultural land to other beneficial uses that consume less water and provide benefits for multiple constituencies. In practice, multibenefit land repurposing involves the process of collaboration among different groups (e.g., growers and community members) and the outcome of converting irrigated agriculture to other multibenefit uses (e.g., groundwater recharge basins with habitat and water quality benefits). It integrates into a single framework the joint objectives of conserving water, creating benefits for society and the environment, and stimulating the growth of participatory governance networks. But the pathways through which multibenefit land repurposing can achieve these objectives have yet to be demonstrated, either empirically or conceptually. To this end, we illustrate conceptually how multibenefit land repurposing can be designed to enhance water security and enable a transition to more resilient landscapes, building a theory of change around three key elements: (i) creating multibenefit outcomes, (ii) improving strategic regional coordination, and (iii) shifting underlying institutional conditions to promote innovation, adaptation, and cooperation. We draw from experience with the ongoing Multibenefit Land Repurposing Program ({MLRP}) in California, which has brought together over 100 different organizations in support of eight regional teams to work collectively on coordinated land transformation. We use examples from {MLRP} to illustrate key components and challenges of the theory of change, including how multibenefit land repurposing may be implemented in practice. Despite being a relatively new approach, we argue that multibenefit land repurposing offers a pathway to building resilient landscapes, including in regions with historically severe and inequitable depletion of water resources.},
