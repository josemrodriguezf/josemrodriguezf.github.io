abstract: 'Achieving water sustainability in many water-scarce regions will require
  reducing consumptive water use by converting irrigated agricultural land to less
  water intensive uses. Conventional approaches to this challenge that emphasize water
  conservation as a singular objective often promote ad hoc practices that temporarily
  leave land idle while missing an opportunity to enhance landscape resilience and
  harness synergies of managing water and land together. Multibenefit land repurposing
  offers an alternative solution to this challenge by strategically transitioning
  irrigated agricultural land to other beneficial uses that consume less water and
  provide benefits for multiple constituencies. In practice, multibenefit land repurposing
  involves the process of collaboration among different groups (e.g., growers and
  community members) and the outcome of converting irrigated agriculture to other
  multibenefit uses (e.g., groundwater recharge basins with habitat and water quality
  benefits). It integrates into a single framework the joint objectives of conserving
  water, creating benefits for society and the environment, and stimulating the growth
  of participatory governance networks. But the pathways through which multibenefit
  land repurposing can achieve these objectives have yet to be demonstrated, either
  empirically or conceptually. To this end, we illustrate conceptually how multibenefit
  land repurposing can be designed to enhance water security and enable a transition
  to more resilient landscapes, building a theory of change around three key elements:
  (i) creating multibenefit outcomes, (ii) improving strategic regional coordination,
  and (iii) shifting underlying institutional conditions to promote innovation, adaptation,
  and cooperation. We draw from experience with the ongoing Multibenefit Land Repurposing
  Program (MLRP) in California, which has brought together over 100 different organizations
  in support of eight regional teams to work collectively on coordinated land transformation.
  We use examples from MLRP to illustrate key components and challenges of the theory
  of change, including how multibenefit land repurposing may be implemented in practice.
  Despite being a relatively new approach, we argue that multibenefit land repurposing
  offers a pathway to building resilient landscapes, including in regions with historically
  severe and inequitable depletion of water resources.'
