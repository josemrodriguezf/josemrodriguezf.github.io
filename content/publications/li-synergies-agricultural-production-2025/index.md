abstract: Conservation planning that enhances the resiliency of biodiversity to climate
  change requires adaptive water and land use decision-making in the most cost-efficient
  way. This has many challenges since landscapes with high biodiversity can embrace
  intense human production activities, particularly agriculture. Conventionally, water
  and land used for conservation are often regarded as tradeoffs to agricultural productivity.
  However, this study found that agricultural water and land use synergize with shorebird
  conservation in the Central Valley, California. If informed decisions are made to
  guide strategic land use, landscapes can adapt to climate change and offer multiple
  benefits. This study used a coupled economic optimization model with a species distribution
  model to consider human factors in ecological impacts. The objective was to assess
  the impacts of agricultural water and land use decisions under different climate
  change scenarios on 10 shorebird species populations in California's Central Valley.
  Our results showed that strategic water and land management can offer favorable
  habitats to targeted shorebirds with a land composition including diversified crop
  categories complementary to wetlands. This study demonstrates that agricultural
  lands can be as important as wetlands to shorebirds to sustain their migratory stages
  throughout the year. Wetland restoration without species habitat preference information
  can lead to population shrinkage since wetland types vary in habitat importance
  to the shorebird species studied in this research. Business as usual, along with
  land use and climate change, will decrease shorebirds' breeding season and population
  to the same degree as they impact non-breeding populations. The synergies between
  agricultural production and shorebird conservation were found in the scenarios that
  favor agricultural production water use but also favor habitat provisioning to shorebirds
  in the Central Valley, California, under climate change.
