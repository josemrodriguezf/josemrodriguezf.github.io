abstract: There is not enough water in California to support current water uses and
  preserve healthy environments. California aquifers have been chronically depleted
  over decades, causing household water insecurity, degrading groundwater-dependent
  ecosystems, affecting small and medium farmers, and inducing subsidence. The California
  government enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act more than a decade
  ago to prevent declining aquifer levels to continue causing undesirable results,
  which has driven the necessity to reduce irrigated agriculture by about half million
  hectares. If this change is left to market forces alone, cropland retirement could
  disrupt local economies and vulnerable communities, increasing the levels of injustice
  for local residents and threatening farmer and farmworker livelihoods. However,
  when cropland repurposing is strategically organized and managed in collaboration
  among all the involved groups, it can enhance quality of life in agricultural disadvantaged
  communities, diversify regional economies, generate local socioeconomic opportunities,
  and improve environmental health while simultaneously fostering food and nutrition
  security and advancing water sustainability. In this study, we present a systems-level,
  coproduced Framework of best practices in cropland repurposing to achieve socioenvironmental
  and economic benefits for all. The Framework is informed and supported by peer-reviewed
  science, authors' first-hand experiences, and public engagement about the topic
  for several years. Our team includes scientists, community leaders, and other experts
  in cropland repurposing, socioenvironmental justice, agriculture, climate change,
  land trusts, disadvantaged communities, energy, nonprofit work, Indigenous knowledge,
  and ecosystems. The Framework includes guiding objectives, best practices, and implementation
  strategies to overcome co-occurring challenges. We conduct an extensive literature
  review of the current status quo to support the best practices identified in our
  Framework. This review and coproduced Framework aim to provide best practices for
  developing new solutions without causing new problems, while fully considering the
  impacts on all groups affected firsthand by cropland repurposing.
