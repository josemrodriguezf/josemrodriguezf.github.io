I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in the Environmental Systems Program and Graduate Student Researcher in the  <a href="https://www.wsm.ucmerced.edu/">Water Systems Management Lab</a> at UC Merced. I am interested on the water-food system and their multiple links with society, environment and economy. My research focuses on system analysis of the coupled water-human systems. I use muoeling tools such as optimization and statistical models to understand the evolution and feed-back between food production and water and how this is affected by exogenous changes such as water policies, climate change, crop prices and crop yields. Also, I am interested on developing visualizations, apps and modeling support tools that can help in the decision making of water and land strategies for sustainable water use and multi-beneffit projects.
