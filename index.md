I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Environmental Systems Program and Graduate Student Researcher in the  at UC Merced <a href="https://www.wsm.ucmerced.edu/">Water Systems Management Lab</a>. My research focuses on coupled water-human systems modeling focusing in agriculture. I use optimization and statistical models to understand the evolution of food production and water and how this is affected by exogenous changes such as water policies, crop prices and crop yields. I incorporate uncertainty and multi-beneffit frameworks in my research.
