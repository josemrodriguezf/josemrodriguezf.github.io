I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in the Environmental Systems Program and Graduate Student Researcher in the  <a href="https://www.wsm.ucmerced.edu/">Water Systems Management Lab</a> at UC Merced. I am interested on water, food production and the multiple links the society, environment and economy have with these two systems. My research focuses on system analysis of the coupled water-human systems. I use mudeling tools such as optimization and statistical models to understand the evolution and feed-back between food production and water and how this is affected by exogenous changes such as water policies, climate change, crop prices and crop yields. Also, I am interested on developing visualizations and supporting tools that can help in the decision support of water and land strategies.
