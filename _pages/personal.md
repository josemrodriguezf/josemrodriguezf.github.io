## California Agricultural Data Visualization

I created with the collaboration of undergraduate studens of our lab a visualization of the Department Water Resources data on crop water use and land use estimates, as well as visualization for USDA NASS data on crop prices, yield, total production and grosss revenue. All the data is visualized at a County Scale Available in the water systems management lab's website in the [agricultural data section](https://wsm.ucmerced.edu/agricultural-data/)




## Global Sensitivity Analysis Indexes Visualization 

This repo shows how to plot Sobol first, second and total order sensitivty indexes. I used R for the visualization and using the outputs obtained from (SALib python library)[https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]. Check out my github [repo](https://github.com/josemrodriguezf/Global_sensitivity_analysis_visualization), you can follow the Rmarkdown example and create similar visualizations for your results.
